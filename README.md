# OctoberCMS GB Imagre Resizer

Images should always be optimized when you upload them and you should avoid sending images over to users that are too big for their device.
This simple little plugin tries to address this issue.

By compressing the images (you can choose between losssless or a specific quality) you upload, you know you will always have an optimized image on display.

The plugin also has a setting which allows you to determine a number of dimensios for your images, and it will automatically resize the images to those dimensions.

@TODO

- One feature I will be adding in the near future is the possibility of choosing if you wish to resize to fit, crop or scale the image to the specified dimensions, and
also determine if the crop will be done based on either center, top, bottom and etc...
